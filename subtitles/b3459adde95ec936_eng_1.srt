1
00:00:02,585 --> 00:00:06,297
Poco, what were you doing
wandering about at this hour?!

2
00:00:06,797 --> 00:00:09,132
P-Papa…

3
00:00:09,884 --> 00:00:14,384
At least you're safe.
Where's Sis?

4
00:00:14,931 --> 00:00:17,308
She went out to look for you.

5
00:00:19,185 --> 00:00:22,354
She… She left the house?!

6
00:00:23,731 --> 00:00:27,443
Poco, what's the matter?
You're acting strange.

7
00:00:27,527 --> 00:00:28,528
Sis!

8
00:00:29,153 --> 00:00:31,780
Sis!

9
00:00:45,211 --> 00:00:49,711
{\an8}<i>Two stars fallen from the heavens</i>

10
00:00:51,384 --> 00:00:55,884
{\an8}<i>Swallowed by waters
swirling light and dark</i>

11
00:00:58,015 --> 00:01:02,515
{\an8}<i>Their ripples move outward,
pulled toward each other</i>

12
00:01:07,858 --> 00:01:12,358
{\an8}<i>The sun will guide the man
who walks the path of honor</i>

13
00:01:14,448 --> 00:01:18,948
{\an8}<i>And for the man
who follows his ambition…</i>

14
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:22,290
{\an8}<i>…a sacrifice awaits</i>

15
00:01:27,795 --> 00:01:32,295
{\an8}<i>With pounding heart and burning will</i>

16
00:01:32,717 --> 00:01:35,720
{\an8}<i>With thundering fists</i>

17
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:39,515
{\an8}<i>And overflowing bravery</i>

18
00:01:39,557 --> 00:01:44,057
{\an8}<i>He steps forward, free of doubt</i>

19
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:49,692
{\an8}<i>A fate determined by his blood</i>

20
00:01:50,276 --> 00:01:53,737
{\an8}<i>JoJo!</i>

21
00:02:07,168 --> 00:02:11,668
{\an8}EPISODE 8:
"BLOODY BATTLE! JOJO & DIO"

22
00:02:13,132 --> 00:02:15,175
For instance…

23
00:02:15,926 --> 00:02:18,595
Behold this lovely rose.

24
00:02:18,846 --> 00:02:23,183
You, my dear, are like this rose.

25
00:02:23,601 --> 00:02:26,687
Pay attention, mademoiselle.

26
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:31,734
Once this flower blooms,
it will soon wither away.

27
00:02:32,318 --> 00:02:34,111
Such a pity, is it not?

28
00:02:35,363 --> 00:02:39,658
What a wonderful age, sixteen!
So pure and innocent!

29
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:44,200
Brimming with delicious energy
isn't she, Lord Dio!

30
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:54,256
The ill-mannered
are unworthy of life.

31
00:02:54,674 --> 00:02:56,801
So, mademoiselle…

32
00:02:57,134 --> 00:02:59,261
I offer you a choice.

33
00:02:59,428 --> 00:03:03,928
I can make you young
and beautiful for all eternity.

34
00:03:04,433 --> 00:03:08,933
However, I am not one to force affection.

35
00:03:11,065 --> 00:03:15,402
You are free to choose
your own destiny.

36
00:03:16,862 --> 00:03:17,821
Devil.

37
00:03:18,072 --> 00:03:20,032
What? I couldn't quite hear.

38
00:03:27,498 --> 00:03:31,210
You're a damned d-devil!
Curse you forever!

39
00:03:51,981 --> 00:03:56,481
How regrettable
our little rendezvous must end.

40
00:03:56,861 --> 00:03:58,153
May I introduce you to…

41
00:04:01,657 --> 00:04:03,533
…the dreaded Doobie.

42
00:04:03,951 --> 00:04:08,451
Since I am not to your liking,
I wish you joy with him.

43
00:04:09,331 --> 00:04:11,541
Farewell, mademoiselle.

44
00:04:31,061 --> 00:04:32,979
W-Who's there?!

45
00:04:34,273 --> 00:04:35,691
Who indeed?

46
00:04:36,358 --> 00:04:40,320
I will not give a zombie
the honor of hearing my name!

47
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:41,697
Sis!

48
00:04:41,781 --> 00:04:42,782
Poco!

49
00:04:58,005 --> 00:05:00,257
I bit 'em! I bit 'em!
Bit 'em lots!

50
00:05:00,341 --> 00:05:03,135
There's something
beneath that mask of his!

51
00:05:03,427 --> 00:05:05,011
What in the…

52
00:05:15,606 --> 00:05:19,401
That zombie is full of snakes!

53
00:05:19,485 --> 00:05:23,238
Venomous cobras
and flesh-eating vipers!

54
00:05:23,697 --> 00:05:25,824
Surprised, are you?

55
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:30,412
Those snakes bit his face,
and not just once!

56
00:05:31,997 --> 00:05:33,289
Not again.

57
00:05:33,916 --> 00:05:36,919
I don't have time for
your sick games, Dio!

58
00:05:45,845 --> 00:05:48,973
Impressive.
He managed to extract the poison.

59
00:05:49,265 --> 00:05:53,765
Extraordinary that he can control
his blood flow after only brief training.

60
00:05:54,478 --> 00:05:58,978
Before passing, Baron Zeppeli
gave his own life energy to Mr. Joestar.

61
00:06:02,403 --> 00:06:06,903
I'll use a bit of Hamon
to boil the blood of those snakes!

62
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:15,665
Sis!

63
00:06:15,958 --> 00:06:16,541
Poco!

64
00:06:16,584 --> 00:06:17,751
Sis!

65
00:06:51,952 --> 00:06:54,788
I'm back from hell, Dio.

66
00:06:55,623 --> 00:06:58,667
Still alive, JoJo?

67
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:04,460
I suppose that means
you've defeated my two knights.

68
00:07:05,633 --> 00:07:10,133
Lord Dio, we await your order
to eliminate him!

69
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:14,183
Allow me to scar his flesh
with my fangs!

70
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:15,309
Dio!

71
00:07:15,726 --> 00:07:18,061
No. This one…

72
00:07:18,562 --> 00:07:21,022
This one belongs to me, Dio!

73
00:07:22,441 --> 00:07:24,651
Allow me to be frank, JoJo.

74
00:07:25,736 --> 00:07:29,865
I didn't want to have to
do this myself.

75
00:07:29,907 --> 00:07:32,910
We were raised together
under the same roof.

76
00:07:32,993 --> 00:07:36,329
I do not delight in turning you
into my undead servant.

77
00:07:36,622 --> 00:07:39,875
That's why I left this business
to my knights.

78
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:45,130
But I underestimated you.

79
00:07:45,673 --> 00:07:50,173
Seeing you alive makes me realize
I was too soft a ruler.

80
00:07:53,514 --> 00:07:58,014
Which is why I have no misgivings
about slaughtering you now!

81
00:07:59,186 --> 00:08:03,398
The feeling is mutual.
I feel no guilt in burying you today!

82
00:08:03,691 --> 00:08:05,693
By the way, what became

83
00:08:05,734 --> 00:08:09,404
of your mustachioed friend
with the gaudy hat?

84
00:08:09,989 --> 00:08:11,573
Did he run off?

85
00:08:12,866 --> 00:08:15,952
Dio, I shall confess.

86
00:08:16,036 --> 00:08:17,787
It pains me as a gentleman, but…

87
00:08:18,539 --> 00:08:23,039
…I, Jonathan Joestar,
am going to kill you, Dio,

88
00:08:24,211 --> 00:08:25,795
out of revenge!

89
00:08:28,507 --> 00:08:30,967
Come, JoJo!

90
00:08:36,098 --> 00:08:38,016
Come, JoJo!

91
00:08:42,896 --> 00:08:43,855
Dire!

92
00:08:43,897 --> 00:08:45,899
JoJo, stand aside.

93
00:08:46,734 --> 00:08:50,696
My time to exact revenge is now.

94
00:08:51,113 --> 00:08:55,613
Zeppeli and I went through two decades
of harsh training together.

95
00:08:57,411 --> 00:09:01,790
Dio, I shall send you
to the depths of hell!

96
00:09:02,499 --> 00:09:06,999
Wait! Dio has hidden abilities!

97
00:09:13,218 --> 00:09:14,969
Hmmm… you have interesting moves.

98
00:09:15,429 --> 00:09:19,929
So this is what you humans
can do with enough training.

99
00:09:23,270 --> 00:09:27,770
In just one night, I have surpassed
the abilities of all men!

100
00:09:33,113 --> 00:09:37,613
Ha! You think you can defeat me
with that tired routine?!

101
00:09:43,373 --> 00:09:45,458
You fell for it, fool!

102
00:09:45,626 --> 00:09:48,003
Thunder Cross Split Attack!

103
00:09:49,463 --> 00:09:53,963
Incredible! By crossing his arms he can
attack while keeping his guard up!

104
00:09:55,636 --> 00:09:57,346
It's the perfect move!

105
00:09:57,429 --> 00:10:00,306
No fighter has ever escaped it.

106
00:10:08,899 --> 00:10:10,025
He's…!

107
00:10:10,609 --> 00:10:13,111
Useless! Useless! Useless!

108
00:10:14,905 --> 00:10:16,114
I-I can't move!

109
00:10:17,157 --> 00:10:18,366
He flash froze him!

110
00:10:18,784 --> 00:10:23,284
Dio vaporized his body's moisture,
freezing him instantly!

111
00:10:24,998 --> 00:10:29,498
Dire can't send Hamon into Dio
unless his blood is flowing!

112
00:10:31,505 --> 00:10:36,005
He's a monster!
He's frozen almost Dire's entire body!

113
00:10:37,511 --> 00:10:39,471
Y-You…

114
00:10:40,055 --> 00:10:42,223
So feeble!

115
00:10:42,307 --> 00:10:46,807
Did you really think your pathetic self
stood a chance against me?! Fool!

116
00:10:47,354 --> 00:10:50,940
So you've all come to
die like dogs!

117
00:10:51,191 --> 00:10:54,736
Allow me to present you with
the most scrumptiously savage death!

118
00:10:54,862 --> 00:10:57,155
- D-Dire!
- Stop!

119
00:11:07,624 --> 00:11:09,500
JoJo, it's time.

120
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:12,671
I'll be sending you
into oblivion next!

121
00:11:18,135 --> 00:11:19,094
Dire!

122
00:11:21,138 --> 00:11:24,141
I imbued that rose with Hamon.
Feel its thorns?

123
00:11:26,310 --> 00:11:27,978
Dire!

124
00:11:30,063 --> 00:11:31,814
How…

125
00:11:32,149 --> 00:11:35,652
How dare you scar my face?!

126
00:11:36,195 --> 00:11:37,404
Dire…

127
00:11:41,742 --> 00:11:42,826
Speedwagon!

128
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:43,660
Here!

129
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:51,539
Dio, I now know how to overwhelm
your freezing attack,

130
00:11:52,836 --> 00:11:55,046
and how to use
my Hamon against you.

131
00:11:55,088 --> 00:11:58,800
All thanks to Dire.

132
00:11:59,092 --> 00:12:03,592
I'll transfer my Hamon to
Blueford's sword of luck and pluck!

133
00:12:10,896 --> 00:12:14,190
How dare you use that vile…

134
00:12:14,524 --> 00:12:19,024
…that vile Hamon on me!

135
00:12:19,696 --> 00:12:21,906
You've pushed your luck far enough!

136
00:12:23,617 --> 00:12:26,828
Enjoy becoming zombie feed!

137
00:12:26,870 --> 00:12:29,873
They'll tear your frightened faces
straight off!

138
00:12:29,915 --> 00:12:30,999
So this is Dio!

139
00:12:31,041 --> 00:12:34,669
The most evil, most despicable being
the world has ever seen!

140
00:12:35,045 --> 00:12:39,257
That composed, refined persona
was just a guise!

141
00:12:39,299 --> 00:12:43,799
Now that he's had a humiliating taste
of Hamon, we witness a true demon!

142
00:12:49,142 --> 00:12:51,894
I will show you no mercy!

143
00:12:53,272 --> 00:12:55,065
I am Pajyu!

144
00:12:55,148 --> 00:12:56,274
Jones!

145
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:57,442
Pluton!

146
00:12:57,484 --> 00:12:58,610
Barnum!

147
00:12:58,652 --> 00:13:01,112
Needle Vein Strike!

148
00:13:06,076 --> 00:13:10,576
Roses are living things,
so Hamon will remain inside of them.

149
00:13:11,999 --> 00:13:14,376
But steel is different.

150
00:13:17,838 --> 00:13:20,048
I have to maintain contact.

151
00:13:22,843 --> 00:13:24,970
There is a great horde of them.

152
00:13:25,637 --> 00:13:28,640
I'll handle them for you.

153
00:13:37,107 --> 00:13:41,607
As far as I can tell,
Dio is as swift as a leopard.

154
00:13:43,864 --> 00:13:47,826
Thanks to Baron Zeppeli,
Jonathan just might keep up.

155
00:13:49,244 --> 00:13:53,744
But Dio is strong enough to
pulverize flesh and bone with ease!

156
00:13:55,709 --> 00:14:00,209
The battle will end
the moment they meet!

157
00:14:09,514 --> 00:14:12,558
I'll squeeze the life out of you!

158
00:14:12,726 --> 00:14:16,271
I shall rid the world
of your demonic ambition!

159
00:14:17,689 --> 00:14:21,025
When did he grab
those roses!

160
00:14:24,863 --> 00:14:25,822
Now!

161
00:14:26,073 --> 00:14:27,491
Good show!

162
00:14:27,866 --> 00:14:31,786
He snuck around to Dio's right,
his blind side!

163
00:14:32,746 --> 00:14:35,707
D-Damn! JoJo is a veteran fighter!

164
00:14:47,969 --> 00:14:49,303
Y-Yes!

165
00:14:54,017 --> 00:14:56,811
He finally defeated Dio!

166
00:14:59,398 --> 00:15:00,607
Wrong,

167
00:15:01,608 --> 00:15:03,026
you fools!

168
00:15:04,194 --> 00:15:05,612
I-I…

169
00:15:06,363 --> 00:15:07,822
I'm frozen!

170
00:15:08,698 --> 00:15:10,658
So feeble!

171
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:16,665
Now you will become
one of my servants of the night!

172
00:15:20,877 --> 00:15:24,672
Your carotid is quiet supple
between my fingers!

173
00:15:24,965 --> 00:15:29,219
It's so pleasantly pliant and warm.

174
00:15:30,011 --> 00:15:30,761
I must kick!

175
00:15:40,021 --> 00:15:41,856
My legs are frozen, too!

176
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:44,025
Useless! Useless! Useless!

177
00:15:44,067 --> 00:15:46,736
Give up, JoJo!

178
00:15:46,945 --> 00:15:51,445
Move and your delicate vein
will burst!

179
00:15:52,826 --> 00:15:57,326
Just a wee prick, and then
your blood for my vampiric essence!

180
00:16:02,461 --> 00:16:04,296
W-We have to help!

181
00:16:05,172 --> 00:16:06,339
Zombies!

182
00:16:07,382 --> 00:16:10,885
Keep those peasants back
for a moment.

183
00:16:11,636 --> 00:16:14,430
They keep coming.

184
00:16:15,390 --> 00:16:17,225
We won't be able to help.

185
00:16:17,517 --> 00:16:22,017
Behold, JoJo, my vampiric essence
as it transforms you into my servant!

186
00:16:24,191 --> 00:16:28,691
You haven't won yet, Dio!
You've made a crucial mistake!

187
00:16:29,821 --> 00:16:30,905
And how so?

188
00:16:32,449 --> 00:16:36,949
To extract my life force,
you haven't completely frozen me!

189
00:16:38,079 --> 00:16:41,207
I can't use my Hamon
if my body is frozen,

190
00:16:41,249 --> 00:16:44,543
but you can't drain
my life energy, either!

191
00:16:44,586 --> 00:16:48,423
Your tactics are flawed!

192
00:16:49,799 --> 00:16:52,176
<i>He's thawing the sword
in the flame!</i>

193
00:16:52,469 --> 00:16:56,969
<i>That blade is conducting the heat
faster than I can freeze it!</i>

194
00:16:57,974 --> 00:17:00,601
<i>He's sending Hamon
through the blade!</i>

195
00:17:02,812 --> 00:17:07,312
Sunlight Yellow Overdrive!

196
00:17:08,568 --> 00:17:09,735
Take this!

197
00:17:09,986 --> 00:17:11,445
He got him!

198
00:17:13,156 --> 00:17:17,656
Look again! You can tell that
the Hamon didn't go through.

199
00:17:19,287 --> 00:17:20,329
My arm…

200
00:17:20,747 --> 00:17:22,915
My arm is frozen again!

201
00:17:23,208 --> 00:17:25,501
It froze just by making contact
with his face!

202
00:17:25,710 --> 00:17:28,796
You underestimate me, JoJo!

203
00:17:35,178 --> 00:17:39,678
I, Dio, respect the explosiveness
of your spirit.

204
00:17:40,850 --> 00:17:45,350
And, I must admit,
that your use of fire was quiet clever.

205
00:17:48,942 --> 00:17:53,237
But JoJo, nothing can escape
my icy grasp.

206
00:17:53,572 --> 00:17:56,074
A single touch to
the arm is all it takes.

207
00:17:56,449 --> 00:17:59,702
I can freeze your entire body
in two seconds.

208
00:18:04,958 --> 00:18:07,502
He expelled the vampiric essence!

209
00:18:07,544 --> 00:18:10,380
Mr. Joestar hasn't given up yet!

210
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:17,800
Why so tense?
Still looking for a fight?

211
00:18:18,763 --> 00:18:23,263
You can resist all you want,
but you're still just a human.

212
00:18:24,644 --> 00:18:29,144
Your Hamon training is useless!
Useless! Useless! Useless! Useless!

213
00:18:32,235 --> 00:18:35,071
A monkey cannot stand
against a human!

214
00:18:35,363 --> 00:18:39,863
You are nothing but
a pathetic monkey, JoJo!

215
00:18:41,411 --> 00:18:45,873
Wrong! With enough conviction,
anything is possible!

216
00:18:45,999 --> 00:18:49,711
Humans learn and evolve!
Let me demonstrate!

217
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:53,589
You won't, because
you'll soon be a zombie!

218
00:18:59,262 --> 00:19:01,722
His hand, his hand is on fire!

219
00:19:02,807 --> 00:19:04,892
He lit his glove on fire!

220
00:19:05,185 --> 00:19:08,188
With that, he might be able
to defeat Dio's freezing attack!

221
00:19:08,521 --> 00:19:11,899
At long last, we learn who wins
and who loses!

222
00:19:12,067 --> 00:19:14,235
The end has come, Dio!

223
00:19:19,949 --> 00:19:21,909
H-He was blocked?!

224
00:19:25,580 --> 00:19:26,414
No!

225
00:19:27,165 --> 00:19:28,457
He's breaking through!

226
00:19:43,556 --> 00:19:46,016
My body… it's melting away!

227
00:19:49,396 --> 00:19:52,524
The pain! The burning!

228
00:19:56,403 --> 00:20:00,903
I was supposed to live
for centuries… forever!

229
00:20:04,744 --> 00:20:07,747
<i>You had to be destroyed, Dio.</i>

230
00:20:09,290 --> 00:20:11,166
I, Dio…

231
00:20:25,515 --> 00:20:27,600
He fired a liquid death-beam
from his eye!

232
00:20:27,642 --> 00:20:31,479
A few centimeters to the right,
and my brain would've been toast!

233
00:20:31,604 --> 00:20:33,439
Blimey!

234
00:20:33,481 --> 00:20:37,568
That, my friend, is what a dying
and desperate demon looks like.

235
00:20:39,154 --> 00:20:41,739
Dio's plunging down the cliff!

236
00:20:58,089 --> 00:20:59,048
Dio…

237
00:21:09,058 --> 00:21:10,309
He's fainted!

238
00:21:10,685 --> 00:21:12,853
He's spent. And well he should be.

239
00:21:13,188 --> 00:21:16,524
Tonight's battle claimed
too many lives.

240
00:21:17,066 --> 00:21:21,361
But why is he shedding tears
for the bad guy?

241
00:21:23,531 --> 00:21:28,031
Because they grew up together.

242
00:21:29,871 --> 00:21:32,999
But me? I can smile happily!

243
00:21:35,585 --> 00:21:38,963
Are you watching, Baron Zeppeli?
He did it!

244
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:42,884
Mr. Joestar finally did it!

245
00:21:43,551 --> 00:21:44,885
Dio is dead.

246
00:21:45,553 --> 00:21:50,053
I don't care what anyone says.
The world has been saved!

247
00:23:26,446 --> 00:23:28,489
{\an8}NEXT EPISODE

248
00:23:29,115 --> 00:23:30,825
What a joyous occasion!

249
00:23:30,867 --> 00:23:32,660
These are tears of joy.

250
00:23:32,952 --> 00:23:34,161
R-Run…

251
00:23:34,245 --> 00:23:36,997
I want to stay like this forever.

252
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:39,459
Is my new body here?

253
00:23:39,459 --> 00:23:41,502
